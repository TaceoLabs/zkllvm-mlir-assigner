# zkML TestSuite

This document serves two purposes.

- It explains how to run tests for the zkML pipeline.
- It keeps track of the supported ONNX operations, along with the current pinned
  version of ONNX-MLIR.

## TLDR: How run Test Suite

In the home directory of this repository, after building the project, run the
following command for a quick check:

```
python tests/run.py --fast
```

If you have some time run the same script without the `--fast` flag (in the home
directory, after building) and grab a coffee, this takes some time:

```
python tests/run.py
```

## Folder Structure

Inside the `/tests` folder (where you found this README.md) is a python script
and two subfolders.

- `/Models` Inside this folder are test cases for pre-trained models. At the
  moment, there are tests for two MNIST models, whereas one is a CNN.
- `/Ops` Inside this folder you can find specific test casses for supported ONNX
  operations.
- `run.py` A python script that executes the tests and gathers the information
  of a run of the test suite. Add the additional flag `--fast` to run only the
  tests in the `/Ops` folder. If you omit the flag, it will also run the tests
  in the `/Models` folder. Testing the pre-trained models will take some time.
- `README.md` This README.

### Quick Check

In contrast to the pre-trained existing models in the `/Models` folder, the
"models" in the `/Ops` folder test a single ONNX operation. For every supported
ONNX operation you can find a subfolder that holds compiled ONNX models that
only consist of the specific operation. E.g., the file `/Ops/Add/AddSimple.mlir`
is compiled from an "ONNX model" only consisting of a single
[ONNX Add operation](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md#Add).

Some of the more involved operations have additional attributes to define their
semantics. In such cases, you can find more than a single test case in the
folder.

The rest of the document exhaustively defines all supported ONNX operations with
known limitations.

# Supported ONNX Operations

The current LLVM version of zkLLVM (`zkllcm-circifier`) is based on 16.0.0-rc4.
Therefore we use onnx-mlir
[at this commit](https://github.com/onnx/onnx-mlir/tree/a04f518c1b0b8e4971d554c399bb54efc00b81db)
as it incorporated with this version of LLVM. This document keeps track of the
supported ONNX operations of the zkML frontend and its limitations.

For further information on the operations, see the
[ONNX documentation](https://github.com/onnx/onnx/blob/main/docs/Operators.md).
